## Overview

**HoMeR** (Hybrid Whole-Body Policies for Mobile Robots) is a hybrid imitation learning framework for mobile manipulation. It combines whole-body control with a hybrid action representation to achieve generalizable and precise robot behavior in both simulation and real-world settings.

## Quick Start

Depending on your use case, please follow the appropriate setup and usage instructions:

### üñ•Ô∏è Simulation-Only

If you are **only using simulation**, refer to:

üìÑ [`SIM.md`](SIM.md)

This guide covers:
- Conda setup on macOS and Linux
- Simulated data collection and annotation
- Training and evaluating HoMeR and baselines in simulation

---

### ü§ñ Real-World

If you plan to use HoMeR in **real (and optionally simulation)**, refer to:

üìÑ [`REAL.md`](REAL.md)

This guide covers:
- Hardware and software setup for real-world deployment
- Real-world data collection and annotation
- Training and evaluating HoMeR and baselines in real
