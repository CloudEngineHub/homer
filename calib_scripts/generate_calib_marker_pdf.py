"""
This script generates a printable ArUco marker for use in hand-eye calibration.
The marker is saved as a high-resolution PDF that can be printed and mounted
on a small piece of cardboard, then placed inside the robot gripper.

To ensure accurate scale, the PDF should be printed at the specified DPI
(e.g., 300 DPI) so that the marker appears at the correct physical size 
(e.g., 50 mm x 50 mm).
